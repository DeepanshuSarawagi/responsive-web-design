          <p id="career"><strong>Career: </strong>
          After graduating from MIT in Arerospace Engineering, Dr. Kalam
          joined as scientist at DRDO. He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was
          also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the
          renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the
          Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project
          director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
          successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July
          1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently
          at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval
           expanded the programme to include more engineers. DR. Kalam developed
         several projects during this tenure as scientist at ISRO which earned him
       the title <em>The Missile Man of India.</em> </p>

          <p id="Presidency"> <strong>Presidency: </strong>After his sucessful tenure at DRDO and ISRO, Dr. Kalam
          was elected as the 11th President of India. During his term as president,
          he was affectionately known as the People's President, saying
          that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had
          taken during his tenure. At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam
          expressed his willingness to consider a second term in office provided
          there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.
           However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential
           election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati
           Bhavan from any political processes. Many, many citizens have also
           expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love and affection
           for me and the aspiration of the people. I am really overwhelmed by
           this support. This being their wish, I respect it.
           I want to thank them for the trust they have in me.</p>
