<!-- In this lesson we are going to learn more about the colors in hsl format
instead of representing colors in their hexa decimal values we can represent them
hsl. HSL stands for Hue which we call it as color, Saturation and it can be
accept values in % A fully saturated color means it has no grayness and L stands
for lightness. Normal lightness would be 50%. and 0% lightness would mean black
and 100% lightness means white.-->
