<!-- CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as
the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line
(think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding
content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is
called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to
override it.

When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify
how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of
the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or
bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away
from where it is normally positioned.
