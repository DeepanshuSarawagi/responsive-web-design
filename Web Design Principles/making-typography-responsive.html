      <h2>How to make typography responsive</h2>
      <p>Instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for
        responsive typography. Viewport units, like percentages, are relative
        units, but they are based off different items. Viewport units are relative
        to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, and percentages
         are relative to the size of the parent container element. My size is
       going to change based on the below viewport units</p>
         <h3>There are 4 viewport units:</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>vw: 10vw is 10% of viewport`s width</li>
           <li>vh: 20vh is 20% of viewport`s height</li>
           <li>vmin: 70vmin is 70% of Viewport`s smaller dimension (height vs. width)</li>
           <li>vmax: 100vmax is 100% of viewport`s bigger dimension. </li>
         </ul>
