      <h1>Importance of responsive image</h1>
      <p>In order to have the image responsive we can set the max-width CSS
      style to 100% rather than specifying in px. So that image wont stretch or
      reduce from its original size. We can also set the image display to be in its
      own block rather than an inline element and setting the height to auto will
      keep the image`s original aspect ration.</p>
