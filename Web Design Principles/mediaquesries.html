      <h1>Importance of media query</h1>
      <p>Media Queries are a technique introduced in CSS3 that change the
      representation of a content based on viewport sizes. The viewport is a
      user's visible area of a web page, and is different depending on the
      device used to access the site.</p>
      <p>As you can see that my font-size is changed to 15px if the max height
      of the device content is 900px using media query. Now if you remove
        media query then I`ll be resized to 20px as my original font size.
