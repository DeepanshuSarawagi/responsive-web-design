<main>
<p> We can create input in HTML tages like below. Please note that input is a
  self closing tag</p>

<input text="" placeholder=" ">
<p> we can nest an input element inside a form element. This will help the user
  to submit the data to a actual server. Additionally we can create submit button
like below which will belp user to submit his data to the server</p>
<p> now add required attribute in the input element if we want the user to
  fill the form with the mandaotry fields. Just type required in the input element</p>
  <form action="/submit-your-data">
    <input text="" required>

    <p> we can also create radio buttons in a form like below asking user to select
      one option. Radio button is also a type of input and it is a best practice
      if we use "for" attribute in label which matches with "id" so that one Radio
      button is created for one "id" and name attribute should be common so that
      user if selects other radio button then previous one is automatically deselected.
    we can also have the default first value of radio button to be selected by default
  by adding the "checked" attribute in radio element of input</p>
      <label for="indoor">
       <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked>Indoor </label>
      <label for="outdoor">
        <input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor</label>
      <p>Checkboxes are a type of input from the user if there are multiple
          options which can be selected. By wrapping an input element inside of a
          label element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the
          label element surrounding it. All related checkbox inputs should have
          a same "name" attribute. We can also have the first checkbox checked by
        adding the "checked attribute in the input element</p>
          <label for="loving">
            <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" checked>Loving </label>
          <label for="caring">
            <input id="caring" type="checkbox" name="personality">Caring </label>
          <label for="affectionate">
            <input id="affectionate" type="checkbox" name="personality">Affectionate </label>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
