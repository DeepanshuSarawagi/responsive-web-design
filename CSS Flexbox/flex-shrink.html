<p>In this lesson we have learnt about flex-shrink. Consider that we have a
flex-container which is smaller in size than the items, then we can use flex-shrink
property for each item to shrink in the container by reducing the size.</p>
<p>flex-shrink accepts the values as a number and higher the number, more the
flex item will shrink. see the flex-shrink property set for box1 and box2.
Note that flex shrink property will not work if you set the width to auto.</p>
