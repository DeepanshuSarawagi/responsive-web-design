      <h2>How to implement the justify content</h2>
      <p>Sometimes the flex items do not fill the space in the flex container.
      It is common to tell the CSS to align and space out the content in certain
    way. We can use justify-content property to align the elements in the flex
  container.</p>
  <p>The axis along which the flex items are placed in the container is called
  the main axis. For a flex direction set to row this line is horizontal which
cuts along the items in the row. For column, this is a vertical line which cuts
along the item in cloumn. To understand more about main axis refer to this
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/images/flex-direction-terms.svg" target="_blank">link</a>
</p>
<h3>justify-content accepts below values:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>flex-start:</strong> aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row,
    this pushes the items to the left of the container. For a column, this pushes
     the items to the top of the container.</li>
     <li><strong>flex-end:</strong> aligns items to the end of the flex container. For a row,
       this pushes the items to the right of the container. For a column, this
       pushes the items to the bottom of the container.</li>
       <li><strong>space-between:</strong> aligns items to the center of the main
         axis, with extra space placed between the items. The first and last items
         are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. For example, in a row
         the first item is against the left side of the container, the last item
          is against the right side of the container, then the other items between
           them are spaced evenly.</li>
           <li><strong>space-around:</strong>similar to space-between but the
             first and last items are not locked to the edges of the container,
             the space is distributed around all the items</li>

</ul>
<p>To learn more about the justify-content, try to experiment the box boxcontainer.
