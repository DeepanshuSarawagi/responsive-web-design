      <h2 class="css-selector red-text">Cat Photo App</h2>
      <!--<h2 style="color: red;">Cat Phto App</h2>-->
      <p>in the css.html document we could see that we have created a separated
        style element and had all h2 elements to be in red color. Now we are
      going to create the css classes and apply that class in the h2 element.
    hence by creating the class we can apply this css class style to other html
  elements in the documents. Also note that classes in css starts with a dot</p>

        .red-text {color: red;}
        .css-selector {font-family: Lobster;}
        .small-image {
          width: 100px;
        }
        .solid-blue-border {
          border-color: blue;
          border-width: 2px;
          border-style: solid;
          border-radius: 20%;
        }
        .silver-background {
          background-color: silver;
        }
        p {
          font-size: 16px;
          font-family: Times New Roman;
        }
        #cat-photo-form{

        [type='checkbox']{

        <p class="red-text"> I`m creating a paragraph here by applying the css
          style class "red-text" here. Check the style element and we can
        see that I`ve added the  font size for all p elements to 16pixels</p>
        <p> we have also added the font-family attribute in style element to set
          all the "p" elements to use font as Times New Roman</p>
          <p>We can also import external fonts by using external libraries and
            use that in our style sheets by applying to them in elements.For ex
            we have imported the google apis font and will apply to h2 elements
            in CSS</p>

        to 100px-->

      <!-- we can give a background color to the text we want to specify-->

        <p>We are going to create a list which cat loves</p>
        <ul>
          <li>milk</li>
          <li>cheese</li>
                  </ul>
          <p> now we are going to create ordered list about two things which
            cat hate</p>
            <ol>
              <li>mouse</li>
              <li>fire</li>

                    <!-- we can also add the id for each elements and later
                    style them and modify specific elements using javascript.
                  we can style the form by using the ID attribute in style
                element. And also id will start with a # and it will be used
              only once. That is each "id" should be unique for each element.
            if there is a class attribute and an ID attribute in a specific
          element then ID attribute preference will have higher importance-->

        <!--now to give the checkboxes a CSS style, we will use the [Type=Attribue]
        CSS selector to give checkboxes desired style. check out the code under
