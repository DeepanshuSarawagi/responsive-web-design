    <h2>Importance of figure element</h2>
    <p>HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption.
      Used together, these items wrap a visual representation (like an image,
      diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility
      boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text
      alternative that explains the figure.</p>

      <p>For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the
      trends or conclusions for users with visual impairments.

      Another challenge covers how to move a table version of the chart's data
      off-screen (using CSS) for screen reader users.</p>
