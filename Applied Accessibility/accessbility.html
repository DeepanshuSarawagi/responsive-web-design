<!-- It is important for a good web designer to understand the importance of
  accessibility for all the users with visual impaired or sound impaired. Those
  who are visually impaired use the audio texts and screen readers and those who
  are hearing impaired use the alternative texts. its always good to have the
  alternative texts in image source-->

    <a href="#notes">Jump to notes section</a>

      <main>
        <h2>Alternative text attribute</h2>
        <p>Sometimes the description of the header would convey the purpose
          of the image and in those cases alt attribute is not required in img
          element however we still need to set the alt attribute with empty
          string</p>

          <p> Using of heirarichal headings is important and it helps the screen
            readers to understand the summary of content what this heding would
            convey. There should be only one h1  headings and subsequent h2
            h6 headings. And all the headings should be in hierarichal order.

            <p> HTML5 introduced new elements that gives developers more options
              in incorporating the accessibility to all the users. These new
              elements are header, footer, section, article, nav and main. A
              webpage should have just one main element and this element wraps the
              main content of the webpage. </p>

              <h2 id="notes">Notes on Articles and Sections</h2>
              <p> article is another one of the new HTML5 elements that adds
                semantic meaning to your markup. Article is a sectioning element,
                and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag
                 works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles. </p>

                 <p>The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly
                   different semantic meaning than article. An article is for
                   standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically
                   related content. They can be used within each other, as needed.
                   For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a
                   section. When there's no relationship between groups of content,
                   then use a div.
                  </p>

                  <p>The nav element is another HTML5 item with the embedded
                    landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation. This tag
                     is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.
                     </p>
                     <nav>
                      <ul>
                        <li><a href="#stealth">Stealth &amp; Agility</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#combat">Combat</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#weapons">Weapons</a></li>
                      </ul>
                    </nav>
                  <p>Similar to header and nav, the footer element has a built-in
                    landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly
                    navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain copyright
                    information or links to related documents that usually sit at
                    the bottom of a page.</p>
